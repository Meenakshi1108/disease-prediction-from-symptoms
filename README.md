# Disease Prediction from Symptoms | Machine Learning 

## Overview
- Implemented a machine learning model to predict diseases based on input symptoms, contributing to early diagnosis and medical decision support.
- Used supervised learning for accurate predictions and explored hidden patterns through unsupervised methods, providing insights into symptom-disease relationships.
- **Tech Stack:** Flask, Python & Matplotlib (Visualization)

## Algorithms Explored
The following algorithms have been explored in code:
- Naive Bayes
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- SVM
- KNN
- Probabilistic Models

## UI Implementation
- Implemented a simple user interface to receive input and display the top 3 predicted diseases.
- The model used is Random Forest, as it showed better performance in our evaluations.

## Usage
Please make sure to install all dependencies from the `app` folder using the following commands:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
